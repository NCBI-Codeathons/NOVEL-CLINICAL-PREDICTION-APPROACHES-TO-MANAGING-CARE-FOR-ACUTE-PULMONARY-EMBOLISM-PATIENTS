A two-dimensional transthoracic * echocardiogram, with color flow Doppler was performed. A two-dimensional * transthoracic echocardiogram with pulsed and continuous Doppler was * performed. The left ventricle is normal in size. Regional wall motion * abnormalities cannot be excluded due to limited visualization. The right * ventricle is normal size. Right ventricular function cannot be assessed * due to poor image quality. TR jet inadequate to quantify RVSP. IVC * dilated with reduced collapse. Evaluation by CVP limited by Bipap * therapy. There is a moderate circumferential pericardial effusion, * measuring up to 1.9cm posterior to LV. There is echogenic material in * the pericardial space. The RV free wall is not well visualized on most * views but there is no clear RV diastolic collapse. There is no * significant respiratory variation across the MV. IVC is dilated but * evaluation limited by Bipap therapy. In conclusion, although there is no * clear echo evidence of tamponade, there are limitations of this study as * noted. Clinical correlation advised. * *** DOPPLER MEASUREMNTS & CALCULATIONS * PA acc time: 0.1 sec * *** LEFT VENTRICLE * The left ventricle is normal in size. LV function appears grossly low * normal to normal. Unable to reliably estimate LV EF. Regional wall * motion abnormalities cannot be excluded due to limited visualization. * *** RIGHT VENTRICLE * The right ventricle is normal size. Right ventricular function cannot be * assessed due to poor image quality. * *** ATRIA * The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is a catheter/pacemaker lead * seen in the right atrium. Right atrial size is normal. * *** MITRAL VALVE * There is mild mitral annular calcification. There is trace mitral * regurgitation. * *** TRICUSPID VALVE * The tricuspid valve is not well visualized. There is trace tricuspid * regurgitation. TR jet inadequate to quantify RVSP. IVC dilated with * reduced collapse. Evaluation by CVP limited by Bipap therapy. * *** AORTIC VALVE * The aortic valve opens well. Trace aortic regurgitation. * *** PULMONIC VALVE * The pulmonic valve is not well visualized.
